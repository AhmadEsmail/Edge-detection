# MATLAB Edge Detection using Prewitt Operator

This MATLAB script performs edge detection on images using the Prewitt operator and non-maximum suppression technique. It detects edges in both horizontal and vertical directions and then suppresses non-maximum pixels to obtain thin edges.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the MATLAB script `prw_edgedet.m`.
2. Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system.
3. Run `prw_edgedet.m` in MATLAB.
4. When prompted, select an image to perform edge detection on.

## Dependencies

This script requires MATLAB.

## Example

Here is an example of the edge detection output:
